# Minecraftn't java
## It ain't Minecraft

This is just a dumb project I am pouring too much effort into.  
It is a Minecraft clone written in Java with online asset updating, Multithreading etc.  
Yet I am still to add a proper player controller.

If you came here, I'm so sorry for you.  

This repository contains the minecraft terrain.png which 99% is copyright Mojang.  
Oh, and it *does* download some Minecraft console music. I'll look into removing that later!
