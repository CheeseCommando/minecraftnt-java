Welcome to the minecraftn't game directory!

Thank you for downloading minecraftn't! This has taken me a lot of work do make, and hopefully I still work on it when
you read this!

I can't charge any money for this, and I don't want to do so, but I'd love if you support me. I have no source of income
as of writing this and I do a lot of work for free. Easiest way to do so is to donate on any itch.io game I've made!

As of writing this, this directory contain 4 main sub-dirs, 3 if you're not using the launcher.
They are quite basic, but still good to know what they do.

versions  - launcher      - Simply contains downloaded game versions(client.jar, game info)
logs      - client        - Contains the latest log plus previous logs(in zip format)
resources - client        - This directory is automatically updated when booting the game. The game downloads the latest assets into here!
custom    - client        - It allows you to replace resources! Create a custom pack by making a subdir with the name
                            of the pack, in which you can add replacements for e.g "pack.json". Example resources are available
                            in client.jar and sometimes in the resource directory.

We've also got imgui.ini, but that one you can ignore if you want to! It is just created by a library I use for debugging UI!

Thanks for playing!
